-=: POST DATA FORMAT :=--------------------------

The JSON Location Tracker protocol is very simple.

The JLT will "POST" http messages to any URL.  The post message will have a
single paramater, "fixes" which will contain a JSON *string*:

    [
        {
            t:  result.timestamp,
            ll: [ result.latitude, result.longitude ],
            ha: result.horizAccuracy,
            va: result.vertAccuracy,
            al: result.altitude,
            vv: [ result.velocity, result.heading ]
        },

        ...,
    ]

The "t" index *may* be an array of timestamps as follows:

    [
        {
            t:  [timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, ... ],
            ll: [ result.latitude, result.longitude ],
            ha: result.horizAccuracy,
            va: result.vertAccuracy,
            al: result.altitude,
            vv: [ result.velocity, result.heading ]
        },

        ...
    ]

CGI data syncs *must* respond with *either* the timestamp of the message or the
*first* timestamp of the message; for each fix in the array of fixes:

    { fix_tlist: [ timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, ... ]}


-=: POST DATA UNITS :=--------------------------

- timestamps (t) is measured in miliseconds since the epoch
- latitude and longitude (ll) is a two tuple, measured in degrees
- accuracy (ha, va) is measured in meters [presumably above mean sea level]
- altitude (al) is in meters
- velocity (vv) is a two tuple.  The first element is the speed in
  meters/second and the second element is the direction in compass azimuth
  degrees
