        <h3>Indicator Meanings</h3>
        <p> There are various text phrases that appear below the
            indicators at the time.  Along the left, they describe the
            number of readings taken and how many were accepted by the
            webserver (e.g., 2 reads, 2 posted).  Along the right, the
            app shows when an HTTP (aka AJAX) request is running (e.g.
            HTTP running)<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>

        <p> In addition to the text messages, there is a slider and
            there are three LEDs.  The slider indicates the buffer
            fill status.  If the slider is full (filling left to
            right), it indicates the buffer is full.  Consider
            increasing the buffer size if this happens frequently.
        </p>

        <p> The blue LED indicates some type of GPS activity.  Usually
            the blue LED indicates a new read being buffered, but it
            can also indicate buffer overruns.  When a buffer overrun
            occurs, the blue LED will light with the red LED
            simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p> The green LED indicates some type of HTTP activity.
            Usually this activity relates to a successful data POST.
            However, when a POST fails, the green LED will light along
            with the red LED.
        </p>

        <h3>Post URL</h3>
        <p> To edit this field, tap-and-hold for a second or two.  The field
            resists accidental edits.  It is the URL at your website you wish
            to post the GPS data to.  There are
            <a href="http://github.com/jettero/jlt/tree/master/cgi/">samples</a>
            in several languages on github (see the About card).
        </p>

        <p> The Post URL is is the full path of the CGI that
            should collect your JSON location posts.  The format of
            the posts is listed in a file called
            &quot;<a href="http://github.com/jettero/jlt/blob/master/PROTOCOL">PROTOCOL</a>&quot;
            in the distribution (ibid).
        </p>

        <h3>View URL</h3>
        <p> The view url isn't used internally.  It is only used when sending
            your location to friends, where it is effectively pasted into the
            message. </p>

        <h3>Update Intervals</h3>
        <p> There are two ways to acquire GPS data from the webOS.
            First, you can ask for a fix, and second, you can
            subscribe to the GPS system and it will give updates as
            often as it likes.  In practice, this tends to be roughly
            every second.  When switched to &quot;Continuous
            Updates&quot;, your device will subscribe to the updates
            and store them as often as they come.
        </p>

        <p> Alternatively, you can set the app to ask for a fix only
            after waiting for a certain amount of time (called the
            Update Interval) after receiving the last fix.
        </p>

        <h3>Buffer Size</h3>
        <p> While waiting for upload confirmation, this app stores the
            GPS fixes locally.  In slow network locations, a larger
            buffer may help ensure successful uploads â€” however, it
            will also consume more local resources.
        </p>

        <p> If the current GPS fix is &quot;very close&quot; to the last
            location, the app will store additional timestamps rather than
            duplicating the gps fix.  The buffer setting affects this timestamp
            queue also.  The app will store up to three times the buffer size
            worth of timestamps in a single message before overflowing.  That
            is, if the buffer size is five messages, the app will store at most
            fifteen timestamps per location entry and only five locations;
            giving at most: seventy-five readings, if everything happens to
            line up just right.
        </p>

        <p> When the message buffer is full and a reading comes in, an older
            messages will be shifted off in FIFO order.  When the timestamp
            buffer of a fix object is full, it will push another message
            into the queue instead.
        </p>

        <h3> Tags and POI </h3>
        <p> In the lower left of the control panel is a submenu for tags and POI. </p>
        <p> If you have noticed a Point of Interest (POI), click POI to send a
            note to the webserver.  This message will be transmitted exactly
            once and the interface will attempt to get a fix as soon as
            possible &mdash; despite any slower update intervals, as above
            described. </p>

        <p> Trip tags, on the other hand, are sent with each fix.  They're
            intended to give text labels to each fix (e.g., "drive to work", "drive
            to cottage"). </p>

        <h3> Send View </h3>
        <p> As a convenient, the JLT may be instructed to prefill an IM/SMS or
            Email with the viewing location of your gps data.  The contents of
            the message will be little more than the view url (if set) above
            described. </p>

        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p> Authentication (if required) depends on the endpoint and related
            negotiation.  If requested, the JLT will pop open a browser for
            authentication purpopses.  WebOS keeps browsers and apps completely
            separate though, so the only way to get the authentication token
            from the website to the application is to cut and paste it over. </p>

        <p> For this reason, the browser has an <em>(i)</em> button you can
            press that will pop up a token request window.   Simply copy your
            auth token &mdash; typically the id of a session on the webserver
            &mdash; to the dialog and press the set button. </p>

        <h3>Side Notes</h3>
        <p> <sup>1</sup> The number of posted messages will sometimes
            lag behind the number of actual reads because of two
            factors: 1) webserver acknowledgments do not contain a
            count and 2) occasionally a reading will be lost when a
            fix message is acknowledged but has gained timestamps
            after the message was sent to the webserver.  This
            behavior is not considered to be a bug at this time.
